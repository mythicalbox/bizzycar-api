**Welcome to our backend customer information system!**

This readme assumes that you have node.js installed correctly.

To get started install the required npm packages:

`# npm install`

Then start two terminals... the first terminal is to run the backend server and the second terminal is to run tests against it.

In the first terminal type:

`# node run start`

and in the second terminal type:

`# npm run test`


Troubleshooting:

If you get a database error, ensure there is an empty folder called "db" in the source folder.
